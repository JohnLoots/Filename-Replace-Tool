# **Filename-Replace-Tool**

Simple package made to rename files in bulk.
This tools works great when working with SciptableObjects of some sort and want to make copies of them.
or animations for that matter.


## How to use this tool.

Simply add it to your package manager by going to Window -> Package Manager and entering the following link:
`[https://github.com/JohnLoots/Filename-Replace-Tool](https://github.com/JohnLoots/Filename-Replace-Tool)`

Then go to Tools -> Filename Replace Tool.

The keyword will be the word you want to replace ( Worker1 ).
The replace word is what you want to replace it with ( Worker2 ).
Worker1ItemData.cs will then become Worker2ItemData.cs

**Important!!** Files need to be placed under the assets folder, it doesnt matter which directory.
But the script gets the relative directory to the assets folder. 
This is because renaming Assets requires a relative path to the assets folder
